# CPSC 8430 Homework 2 - Video Caption Generation 

This folder contains all the scripts and python files used to generate the report HW2_report_jkbrook

## How to run the files:
A conda environment containing the packages pytorch, matplotlib, and other necessary packages was utilized and will be needed when running the files. This environment is called within the provided scripts. If the environment you are using is not called ***pytorch*** then you will need to modify these lines to include the correct name.

### Training
The model (trained_model.h5) was generated by running the ***training.py*** file using the ***train.sh*** script. If wanting to run this on your own, parts of the script and python files will need to be modified to include the users own working directory prior to executing the command:
```
# When in working directory with files
sbatch train.sh
```
### Testing
To test the model, ***testing.py*** can be run using ***test.sh***. 

This script utilizes the required script ***hw2_seq2seq.sh***, which requires the input of the testing data directory as well as the desired output file name. Parts of the script (***test.sh***) and python files will need to be modified to include the user's own working directory as well as any changes to the desired testing data directory and output file name prior to executing the command:
```
# When in working directory with files
sbatch test.sh
```
